## Getting Started

In the search bar fetch a game that you would like to know the price, ESRB rating, preview and availability of. Once the game is entered, the stats on show underneath a snapshot of the game. Not only is the stats there but also three buttons (share, like and preview).The share button allows user to share a link of their choosen game card and the preview gives the user a short video of the game. The like button saves the the game choice which is stored in the "Your Likes" tab (revisitable). There is a contact page for any of those with questions, comments or concerns. Lastly, the "About Us" page gives you a glimpse to the team members and their personalities.
